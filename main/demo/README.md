This folder is for demonstration of OCLM performance. It should run from main folder (use mv to move all files one level up) 

run the demo from run.sh script. Notice that oclm\_c.py provides real domain probailities for the purpose of the demo however if one wishes to use negative log domain the replace real() with loge() in required places.
